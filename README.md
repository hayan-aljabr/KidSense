## Introduction

KidSense is an application designed to assist parents with hearing impairments or disabilities. This innovative solution utilizes cutting-edge neural network models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and CRNN (CNN-RNN), coupled with the ESC-50 dataset containing over 2000 environmental sounds. Additionally, we leverage the pre-trained YamNet model to extract features from the sound data.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Sound Detection**: KidSense detects sounds in the environment in real-time, enabling parents to stay informed about their child's activities.
- **Notification System**: Upon detecting a sound, KidSense sends instant notifications to the parent's mobile device, indicating the type of sound detected.
- **Customizable Alerts**: Parents can customize alerts based on specific sounds or noise levels, ensuring they receive notifications tailored to their preferences.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The KidSense app features an intuitive interface, making it accessible and easy to use for parents with varying levels of technical expertise.

## Getting Started

To begin using KidSense, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Download the KidSense app from the App Store or Google Play Store on your mobile device.
2. **Setup**: Sign up for an account and configure your notification preferences within the app.
3. **Activation**: Enable the app to access your device's microphone to start detecting sounds.

## Technical Details

KidSense utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques and datasets:

- **Neural Network Models**: We employ RNN, CNN, and CRNN models to analyze and classify environmental sounds effectively.
- **ESC-50 Dataset**: Our application is trained on the ESC-50 dataset, which comprises 2000 diverse environmental sounds, ensuring robust performance.
- **YamNet Feature Extraction**: We leverage the pre-trained YamNet model to extract high-level features from audio data, enhancing the accuracy of sound classification.
